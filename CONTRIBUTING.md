When contributing to this repository, and you are not part of the team developing the project, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue before making a change.

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Linting & Commit message linting

Make sure that all commit messages adhere to the standards defined in [the commit linter](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/#what-is-commitlint), otherwise your commits will be rejected.

Make sure you also adhere to the [normal lint rules](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint). If you have issues getting the normal linting right, you can use the `//nolint` comment, but please use it sparingly and accompany it with a reason _why_ the linting is disabled.
