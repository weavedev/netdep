The Parsing stage involves construction of necessary data structures for the analysis of the target project.
This stage may include constructing the ASTs or some CallGraph structs, which help find usages of
wrapped HTTP types and methods (see https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/callgraph).
Refer to the Project plan, chapter 5 for more information.
